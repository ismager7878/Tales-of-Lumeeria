Hello, let me tell you how to make awesome subclasses

First do some setup:
1. Make sure Node.js is installed, and restart vs-code
2. Open the project terminal(Ctrl + L-Shift + Ã¦) Then execute the command: "npm install"
3. Perfect now you don't have to do any of that ever again, unless i tell you too :-P 

How to actually use it:
1. Open the project terminal and make it an apropiate size
2. Then execute the command "node subclass_maker.js"
3. Follow the instructions on screen.
4. If you make any mistake you can use Ctrl-C to stop to program and try again
5. When your done go the updated JSON will be copied to your clipboard.
6. Go into the JSON file and Ctrl-A Ctrl-V
7. Update your homebrew in 5e.tools, and you should now have your new class, if something doesn't load, 
    or isn't showed as expected, Ctrl-Z in JSON file to undo the change and call for help. If your lucky your neighbor can hear you.
