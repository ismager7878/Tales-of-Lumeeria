Their bodies are covered in a thin coat of soft fur that comes in a variety of colors, including chestnut, ivory, and even golden hues. Despite their fur, Boyaks grow lengthy hair on their heads, mimicking the diverse hairstyles that humans sport. Male and female Boyaks alike take pride in elaborate hairstyles, especially for important social functions, with the hair matching the color of their fur. With long, prehensile tails and hand-like feet capable of articulate movements, Boyaks have adapted seamlessly to their arboreal environments.",

The fur that grows on their bodies is thin, but dark, giving them an obscured appearance in dark conditions, though ratfolk commonly have fur colors ranging from light browns to dark gray and black.

This gives them an insightful attitude and they will always speak carefully, with few words and cautious thought. This, by extension, gives Vepus a disdain for authority figures and those in high standing. Many Vepus have little respect for such people as they believe in protecting themselves and righting wrongs done to them on their own",

Though Vepuses are cautious, they are neither fearful nor stupid, and the opportunity to face enemies and beat traps give them a sense of challenge. For the Vepus, the chance to complete a task no one else can is exhilarating.  The Vepuses dislike the norms placed on them, but while they don't seek to affect such change in attitude on a large scale, they place great value on the opinions of those few they come to trust. This trust comes with time and much effort and can be lost easily if abused."

        "The Architects of Lumeeria are masters of arcane innovation, blending ancient magic with cutting-edge engineering. Their art lies in harnessing arcane crystals—natural repositories of magical energy—and inscribing them with intricate, function-driven runes to manipulate the raw power within. Unlike wizards who memorize spells or sorcerers born with innate magic, Architects approach magic as a system of precision, logic, and creativity.",
        "Architects first emerged during the Reconstruction Era after the Millennia of the Lost, when magic and technology had to be united to rebuild civilizations. These pioneers discovered that by embedding specific arcane scripts into crystals, they could replicate the effects of traditional spells without needing a caster. This breakthrough revolutionized industry, warfare, and daily life, leading to a technological renaissance in Lumeeria.",
        "From walking automata powered by crystal cores to weapons of war that unleash devastating magical energy, Architects have redefined the limits of what magic can achieve. Their workshops, often brimming with mechanical constructs and glowing runes, are hubs of invention. However, their work requires precision—an incorrectly inscribed crystal can lead to catastrophic failures.",
        "While revered for their brilliance, Architects tread a dangerous path. Overuse or misuse of arcane crystals brings huge risks with dire consequences. Thus, Architects are often viewed with a mix of admiration and caution. To them, the world is not just a place to live—it is a puzzle to decode, reimagine, and transform.",
        "Architects are divided into various study paths, each pushing the boundaries of innovation. Whether focused on creating intricate constructs, enhancing weapons, or exploring new energy sources, Architects stand as the bridge between the arcane past and the technological future of Lumeeria."

They are feared not only for their formidable combat abilities but also for their controversial practice of soul manipulation. In a world where souls are the essence of life and balance, the Soulburner's unorthodox methods have drawn the ire of religious orders and individuals alike. The cosmic balance of Lumeeria hinges on the free flow of souls, and any disruption to this delicate equilibrium is met with swift and severe retribution. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, Soulburners continue to walk their perilous path, driven by an insatiable thirst for power and mastery over their own destiny.",
                "As Soulburners harness the power of their own souls to fuel their abilities, they walk a precarious path between power and peril. Each act of soul manipulation exacts a toll on their physical and spiritual well-being, eroding away at their vitality and life expectancy. The exact toll this takes on their longevity remains unknown, but it is widely believed that few Soulburners live to old age. The lure of power may be irresistible, but the cost of wielding soul power is steep indeed, and only the most determined and resilient souls dare to embrace its dark embrace.",
                "Soulburners have often been regarded with suspicion and fear, their abilities associated with darkness and corruption. Throughout history, there have been infamous individuals who have embraced the path of the Soulburner, wielding their power with ruthless efficiency. Among them, none are as notorious as Tionne Vestes, whose name is synonymous with destruction and chaos.",

Through unknown means, he transcended the boundaries of conventional Soulkeeper abilities, forsaking his martial prowess in favor of wielding soul power with unmatched potency.",
                "His legacy is one of devastation, as he brought ruin to the once-beautiful Feylands, leaving a trail of destruction in his wake. Tales of his atrocities echo through the annals of history, serving as a grim reminder of the dangers posed by those who dare to harness the power of the soul. Despite his eventual downfall, Tionne Vestes remains a cautionary tale, a testament to the dark allure and perilous consequences of delving too greedily and too deeply into the forbidden arts of soul manipulation.",

Many good cloud giants refuse to worship the deceitful Memnor, and a storm giant dwelling in the icy mountains of the north might pay more homage to Thrym than Stronmaus.

This conflict saw Zeena, the Blood Monarch, and Alaso clash in a destructive struggle, devastating the continent of Navaro. As the two forces of undeath vied for supremacy, Alaso shaped these gargantuan monstrosities to ravage the battlefield, tearing through both living and undead alike.",
          "Deathworms were designed to burrow beneath the earth, emerging with terrifying speed to devour entire battalions or drag down the unfortunate into the cursed soil. Their very presence exudes necrotic energy, corrupting the land and leaving it barren in their wake. Even after the war ended, many Deathworms remained in the desolate, accursed lands of Navaro, eternally hunting anything that still clings to life. These colossal undead creatures now roam the wasteland, driven by an insatiable hunger for destruction."
