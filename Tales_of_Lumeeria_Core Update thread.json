They are feared not only for their formidable combat abilities but also for their controversial practice of soul manipulation. In a world where souls are the essence of life and balance, the Soulburner's unorthodox methods have drawn the ire of religious orders and individuals alike. The cosmic balance of Lumeeria hinges on the free flow of souls, and any disruption to this delicate equilibrium is met with swift and severe retribution. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, Soulburners continue to walk their perilous path, driven by an insatiable thirst for power and mastery over their own destiny.",
                "As Soulburners harness the power of their own souls to fuel their abilities, they walk a precarious path between power and peril. Each act of soul manipulation exacts a toll on their physical and spiritual well-being, eroding away at their vitality and life expectancy. The exact toll this takes on their longevity remains unknown, but it is widely believed that few Soulburners live to old age. The lure of power may be irresistible, but the cost of wielding soul power is steep indeed, and only the most determined and resilient souls dare to embrace its dark embrace.",
                "Soulburners have often been regarded with suspicion and fear, their abilities associated with darkness and corruption. Throughout history, there have been infamous individuals who have embraced the path of the Soulburner, wielding their power with ruthless efficiency. Among them, none are as notorious as Tionne Vestes, whose name is synonymous with destruction and chaos.",

Through unknown means, he transcended the boundaries of conventional Soulkeeper abilities, forsaking his martial prowess in favor of wielding soul power with unmatched potency.",
                "His legacy is one of devastation, as he brought ruin to the once-beautiful Feylands, leaving a trail of destruction in his wake. Tales of his atrocities echo through the annals of history, serving as a grim reminder of the dangers posed by those who dare to harness the power of the soul. Despite his eventual downfall, Tionne Vestes remains a cautionary tale, a testament to the dark allure and perilous consequences of delving too greedily and too deeply into the forbidden arts of soul manipulation.",
